## Project description - TODO
## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation, please [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Dependencies installation is done using the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```bash
$ npm init
```
## Settings

Create a .env file in the root of the repository with the variable PORT={number} (the port must match the one configured in the frontend repository).

## Quick Start

Run the following command and wait to see "Server running, port: {number}" in the console.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

The project uses Nodemon, which means the server will automatically restart every time a change is made in any file.
